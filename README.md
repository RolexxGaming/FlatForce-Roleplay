# FlatForce-Roleplay
This gamemode is a very different version of DarkRP. We started with the DarkRP gamemode, and frome there, we formed our own gamemode. What seperates our version of DarkRP from the base DarkRP, is the fact that there are no addons. Everything that the player sees on the server is built directly into the gamemode. We don't even use the modification addon for DarkRP because everything is being edited inside the gamemode itself.

# Installation
In order to install this gamemode simply drop it in the gamemodes folder of your server.

# Setup
The first thing to do for setup would be to connect to a MySQL database. This is highly recommended for your gamemode to work correctly, because without MySQL some of the built in features will not save their data. Once you have that done, you can do your basic configuration such as adding a donation system, or jobs. You don't have to worry about weapons, because we have already built that into the gamemode itself. As for the admin mod, we have built custom admin tools into the gamemode as well.
